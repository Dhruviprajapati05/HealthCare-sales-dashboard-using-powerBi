# HealthCare-sales-dashboard-using-powerBi
Created interactive dashboards using Power BI with visualizations like bar charts, column charts, donut charts and pie charts. Cleaned and transformed sales data using Power Query, and applied DAX to calculate KPIs like sales growth and profit margins. Analyzed sales , generated insights to improve decision-making and total revenue strategies.

## Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to visualize, monitor, and analyze key healthcare performance indicators. This dashboard aims to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, treatment outcomes, hospital performance, and resource utilization, enabling healthcare stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and overall service quality.

### Data Collection

Gather the healthcare dataset (patient records, treatments, revenue, etc.).

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format data properly.

### Data Loading

Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.

### Data Modeling

Create relationships between tables (e.g., Patients ↔ Departments).

### KPI Selection

Choose main metrics (Total Patients, Top Diseases, Revenue, etc.).

### Dashboard Design

Create charts, cards, and filters for clear visualization.

### Interactivity Setup

Add slicers, filters, and drill-through options for easy exploration.

### Testing & Validation

Verify data accuracy and dashboard functionality.

### Deployment & Sharing

Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service and share with stakeholders.
